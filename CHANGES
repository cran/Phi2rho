Changes from Phi2rho 1.0 (20. 7. 2023) to Phi2rho 1.0.1:
--------------------------------------------------------

1.  In the documentation, the incomplete reference Komelj, J.
    (2023) is completed.

2.  When calling OwenT( h, ±Inf, FALSE, "tOwenT" ), the
    parameter control reported an error
    "Error in tOwenT(...) : all(is.finite(r)) is not TRUE".
    Consequently, calling Phi2xy( x, 0, rho, FALSE, "tOwenT" ),
    which implies r = ±Inf, reported the same. This bug has
    been fixed.
